Cryptotronix Contributor Agreement
===

This repo contains the Cryptotronix Contributor Agreement (CCA).  It
is modified from the
[Oracle Contributor Agreement](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oca-486395.html).
While the [pdf](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oca-405177.pdf) is
available on the website, and while other projects use the same
agreement, I couldn't find the actual text anywhere.  That and I'm
partial to LaTeX, so I figured I would re-create here and share.

I believe this to be the most fair contributor agreement that I've
found.  It does not require copyright assignment and it states that
your contributions must be licensed under a FSF or OSI approved
license.  If there is a better agreement out there, I'd be willing to
consider it.

Cryptotronix requires a signed agreement prior to accepting
non-trivial pull requests.
